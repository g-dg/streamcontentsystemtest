Garnet DeGelder's Interim Stream Content System
===============================================

***This documentation is in progress***

***IMPORTANT! This program is in rapid development. Anything can break at any time. If you use this, it is recommended that you don't update it without testing the new version.***

This is a program that was created to make management of livestream content easier.
It is only intended as an interim replacement until my new program ([StreamSys](https://github.com/g-dg/streamsys)) is completed.


Security
========

***DANGER! While this program shouldn't allow access to files and processes on the server that shouldn't be accessed (when configured correctly), there is no authentication and anyone can change the current display content and song content, especially since the server currently only uses unencrypted HTTP.***

There are future plans to add some authentication and TLS support.


Installation
============

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.md.
